#
# [settings]
# Here you can define the operating system and computer architecture for the
# system you are using to compile, as well as the target computer architecture
# / OS that you are building to. You can define the name of the compiler, as
# well as the version of C++ used by the project (e.g. 11, 14, 17, etc), and
# the compiler version.
#
# [build_requires]
# This is for defining additional system requirements that are needed in order
# to perform a successful build. These are things that may or may not already
# be installed globally on your system. If they are not, then you can define
# what they are in the same format as the `[requires]` section of the `
# conanfile, and they will be downloaded and installed in a local directory
# specific to the project and used in the build.
#
# [env]
# This is for any environmental variables that may need to be defined. In most
# cases, Conan will just use your existing environmental variables, but you may
# wish to override them here, or define them here for clarity.
